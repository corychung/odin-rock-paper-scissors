# Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is [live on Github Pages.](https://corychung.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/)

This is my rock paper scissors project for The Odin Project. This contains both the HTML and JS from the first draft of the project as well as the CSS from the second draft.

This was my first project that combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all into one cohesive document, so I learned a lot about how these three mesh together and are used in conjunction with each other. The Odin Project has been a great help in developing these front-end skills but I also spent much time getting familiar with reading through documentation as well as knowing how to properly search for my specific issues.
